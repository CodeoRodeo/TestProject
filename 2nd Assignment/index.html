          <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>
          <p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</p>
          <p>NASA is not about the ‘Adventure of Human Space Exploration’…We won’t be doing it just to get out there in space – we’ll be doing it because the things we learn out there will be making life better for a lot of people who won’t be able to go.</p>
          <p>The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p>
          <p>Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.</p>

          <p>Well, there's a probability of anything. Statistically speaking, if you gave typewriters to a treeful of monkeys, they'd eventually produce the works of William Shakespeare.</p>
          <p>Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? The world's about to end, and here I am, stuck in traffic. Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance.</p>
          <p>My writing gets worse and worse. Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Renewed? Have I? That's it, I've been renewed. It's part of the TARDIS. Without it I couldn't survive.</p>
